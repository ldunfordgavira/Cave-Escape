<h1>As you move on you discover an opening shining with light you hope that you are close to escaping, but as you continue to move towards it your hope fades as the light comes from a whole in the roof. When suddenly you are hit by a wave of heat as a geyser opens up in front of you forcing you to move back. You watch as more open up and then stop this pattern continues to go on and as you are watching you notice that there is an exit on the other side.
