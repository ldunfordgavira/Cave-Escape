<h1>You decide to sprint through the natural minefield avoiding the areas where you saw the geyser's rise as you get half way they start opening up behind you slowly getting closer and closer to you, the floor is slippery with the hot boiling water as the geysers are have covered the whole room. You are almost through and just one more obstacle remains the exit is on a raised platform with what appears to be a ramp on one side, but that will take some time, time you may not have.
