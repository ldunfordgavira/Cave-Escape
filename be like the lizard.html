<h1>As you run one of the snakes manages to grab a hold of your leg with its razor sharp teeth, you just keep running, like that lizard you saw on TV once and you manage to outrun the swarm and pull off the remaining snakes who slither away back the way you came, you keep on moving for a little while till you find a good place to stop.
You tend to your wounds and move on.
