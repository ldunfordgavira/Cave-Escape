<h1>You slowly drop to the floor in attempt to make the bear believe you are not a threat, as the bear nears it begins to slow down unsure of what to do it paws aggressively at first believing that you may still be a threat, you stay quiet and after a few minutes it loses interest believing you to be dead or no longer a threat. You wait a couple minutes and slowly walk towards the exit leaving battered and bruised but alive.
