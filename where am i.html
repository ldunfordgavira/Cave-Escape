<h1>You wake up with a scream on the hard stone floor, your body screaming at you as it cries out for help. You force yourself to get up and assess your injuries. Your hands are cut up and covered in blood, but your main concern is the gash on your head as you can feel the blood dripping down your face. You rip off a part of your clothes and make a makeshift tourniquet to stop the bleeding. You need to escape soon
