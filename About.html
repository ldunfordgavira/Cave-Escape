<h1>Hi I'm Luis, I am currently a student at Plymouth University on the Computer Science and Games Development course and am on my first year. I am keen to get underway with the art aspect of games development and am curretnyl enjoying the design aspect as well and hopefully you may discover that through the game. My key hobbies include video games(duh), airsoft and drawing (which I'm trying to transfer to digital art). Hopefully you enjoy the game. Thank you.
