<h1>You immediately turn and sprint towards the exit, the bear easily catches up with you as it is much faster. It knocks you down to the ground and begins to cut you with its claws it then takes a bite out of your leg. After a few minutes of an unrelenting attack it leaves believing you are dead, you slowly lose consciousness and in a last attempt to survive crawl towards the exit to no avail. You pass away seconds later.
