<h1>You begin to climb upwards not being able to see your final destination, as you climb and climb and climb the crevice begins to widen out making it harder for you to climb up but just as you are about to give up your hand reaches the top and you pull yourself over; into utter darkness. You fumble around and begin to panic not being able to see past the end of your nose you think about what you need to do next.
