<h1>You wake up in a dark mysterious cavern with no memory of how you got there and a splitting headache. You notice that you are wearing basic clothing and have backpack lying next to you, looking around you struggle to make out what else is in the room. You notice a breeze running through the cavern and realise that there is a small tunnel leading out of the room.
