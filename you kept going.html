<h1>As you walk through the last part of the tunnel you begin to hear heavy breathing and as you exit the tunnel and walk around a corner you come across a sleeping bear at least 5 times your size, you carefully make your way around in attempt not to wake it up, as you are nearing the exit to the room you slip and fall to the ground waking the bear. It slowly gets up and looks at you, then it begins to charge.
